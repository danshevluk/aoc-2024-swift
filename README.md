# Advent of Code 2024

🎄 This is a template for solving [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles in Swift!

How to start solving puzzles:
1. Start with 'Day 1', see instructions [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1).
2. Create your `PuzzleSolver` struct and add it to the solvers array. You can see [an example for 'Day 1'](Sources/AdventOfCode/Solvers/Day1Solver.swift).
3. Add your input to the [inputs](inputs) folder.
4. Get an answer with a CLI command:
    ```sh
    swift run solve-aoc --day 1 --part two inputs/day1-example
    ```
